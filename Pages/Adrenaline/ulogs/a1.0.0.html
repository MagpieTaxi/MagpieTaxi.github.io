                <h4>Comments</h4>
                <p>for the people that actually care about this game enough to find this: adrenaline is not cancelled, and will begin further development on 5/15/24. Future updates will be posted in the discord server, and on this website. Eventually, after i get the game into a semi-playable state, i will open up tester applications and allow people that i choose to help playtest the game. Stay tuned for adrenaline's eventual release!</p>
