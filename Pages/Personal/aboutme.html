                    <p style="width: 80%;">Hello! I'm MagpieTaxi. I commonly go by some variant of this username online. (e.g. Magpie919) <br>You may know me from some of the games that I've worked on, or from my prescence in other communities. My real name is Alex, but I would much prefer people online to just call me Magpie. (Or just Mag for short) As of writing this, I am 14 years old, and my birthday is on 9/19.</p>

                            <hr>
                            <p>I developed my obsession with computers and programming around the age of nine, and started learning python as my first language around that time. Of course, this fell through.</p>
                            <p>After a couple more years, I picked up programming again late into 2020 when I was eleven with Roblox Studio. Creating games in the Roblox engine was, obviously, a lot easier than trying to learn programming by writing independent python programs.</p>
                            <p>Over the years, i have learned much more about the digital world than i originally intended, as with most things. I plan to pursue an education in computer engineering, and eventually turn this hobby into an occupation.</p>

                            <h3>Parkour</h3>
                            <hr>
                            <p>I believe that I first found parkour from a Roblox game I played created by Hudzell, aptly named "Parkour".</p>
                            <p>Playing this game for the first time completely changed my life, and I don't exaggerate when i say this. You may have seen screenshots online of people with upwards of two thousand hours on a specific game, and this entire genre is exactly that for me.</p>
                            <p>I managed to rack up around 500 hours on Hudzell's Parkour alone, before another parkour game called District Cascade came into my view. Before this, there weren't any other parkour games (of high quality at least) on the site, and i was instantly hooked. This game was in very early development, and had a very small community. I was able to interact with the developer Snowy (or Fireyauto), suggest things for the game, and watch it grow. The advent of District Cascade inspired me to create my own parkour game. If Snowy could do it, so could I!</p>
                            <p>Thus begins the story of Adrenaline, my passion project and favorite child. I had many projects before this, but none resonated with me as much as Adrenaline did. Even before District Cascade, I had wanted to create my own parkour game, but I had no idea how or even if i could. Snowy's project just showed me that it was possible, and inadvertently pushed me to make my own.</p>
                            <p>I say inadvertently because, in reality, the main reason I started the project was because of some issues I had with other parkour games. District Cascade was an alternative, and it showed me that things could be different. In my eyes, both competitors had very obvious flaws that were quite hard to ignore. There were only the two, so I had nowhere to turn but to myself. Adrenaline is to me a parkour game that perfectly fits my playstyle and desires. And plus, even if I had a problem with the game, I could easily change it, because I created it.</p>

                            <hr>
                            <p>I have always been a very creative person. My first creative obsession was with architecture, and that phase lasted for the first seven years of my life. Even now I still enjoy architecture, but I have things I am more interested in, like programming.</p>
                            <p>My artistic capabilities extend all the way from architecture to website design, yet I am helpless with a brush. Traditional painting is completely beyond me. I would like to learn to draw someday, but I don't see it happening in the near future. For now, I stick to my other means.</p>
                            <p>The main form of art that I have created is in the form of games. Interactive experiences that I use to fully show off a world and its inhabitants. Games can be some of the most impactful forms of media people can come across, and I love to exploit that as much as possible.</p>

                            <hr>
                            <p>I've always found it difficult to pick favorites. In my eyes, everything has its own specific purpose, excelling at that and failing at others. Simply picking a 'favorite food' would be picking from too wide of an umbrella. There are many many things that i would claim to be my favorite, and often I can't pick one to rise above all others in an entire category of stuff.</p>
                            <p>Procuring a list of many favorites would be much easier than having to pick a single one. I could say that my favorite food was Sauerkraut, but that would be ignoring many other favorites that I have, like pistachios or tilapia.</p>
