                <p style="text-indent: 2rem;">Adrenaline is a game made by me (MagpieTaxi) as a passion project,
                     and is inspired by many other parkor games such as Mirror's Edge, Huzell's Parkour (Legacy and Reborn), 
                     District Cascade, and the real-world sport of parkour. Adrenaline was initially started around mid 2023 as a 
                    quick project because of my dissatisfaction with other popular parkour games. Over time, it grew into something
                    much more than i initially intended it to be. As of 5/14/24, it is currently worked on by me and my friend Galaxial,
                     and is under heavy development.
